Consumers believe our competitive advantage is convenience and quality of service. Convenience is derived from the online versus offline experience coupled with an easy product experience. Quality of service is mostly demonstrated by speed of service where Xoom can pay out an order usually in minutes, but we also offer a unique ability to deposit money into non US bank accounts faster than any other service, and with total transparency to the consumer (no one can do this but Xoom).

The Xoom.com site is the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive stack of technology. Our architecture includes engines for anti-fraud, compliance, payment processing, customized disbursement, treasury and FX, accounting and finance, and customer/partner operations.

You will be an integral part of the engineering team in a small, startup culture that walks the walk regarding the importance of QA.  We need you to apply your keen mind to the questions, ""Will the code run?"", ""Can it scale?"", and, most importantly, ""Will our customers love and use this?""  To get to this point, we need your judgment and customer mindset to prioritize what needs testing, and what doesn't.	Specifically, the testing you'll do involves multiple devices (tablet, web, mobile) on a robust stack that's JavaScript/HTML5 on the frontend, with a slick, distributed data processing backend that uses Java and Scala -- not your average ""full stack""! 	About You	You are an engineer who ""gets"" the importance of creating products that delight customers.  You keep their perspective in mind as you work on ways to test (OK: Break!) our software, so you can educate us about code problems and elucidate us about what will cause our customers pain, and what will make the fans of our product.	You have more than a passing familiarity managing products that are based in Java, Scala and/or JavaScript.  You have thorough understanding web architecture and success implementing and executing QA in a startup culture. 	More About You	You are an experienced QA Engineer with a BS in Computer Science or a related discipline.  You understand the importance of automating QA to account for human factors, while keeping an eye on non-automated, custom cases. You've used the major tools like Selenium, QUnit, JsUnit, Jasmine for test automation on all commonly used and emerging web platforms, and know how to set up and deploy test automation systems, adhering to short development cycles.	You have at least five years of software QA/test experience in a *nix environment, and have been progressively involved with more interesting and innovative testing methods for a customer-facing software product or web service.  You have good scripting skills in at least one common language (e.g., Python, Perl, Shell).	You never back away from a technical challenge.  You love startup environments and have recent experience working at one.  You relish the idea of being the first QA person on our engineering team.

You  have to be self directed, team oriented, and actually know and care about what our users are trying to accomplish by using our products.

Conduct ongoing systems analysis and perform routine maintenance
Collaborate with the dev team to assess feasibility and priority of new features
Participate in testing regularly scheduled releases (think continuous development and deployment)

Collaborate with systems engineering to optimize scale, network efficiency and problem resolution
Stay current with relevant technologies, proactively develop and suggest architecture changes
Commitment to getting it done... properly, the first time

Detailed understanding of database schema and an accurate image of data formats
Experience with building and measuring performance of web services; SOAP, XML, REST and JSON

About You:
You approach software development as a craft, more than just scratching code. You are experienced in .NET development and are excited about building tools and systems to assure quality code goes out the door each and every time. You are not afraid of change, but you see the value in structure and best practices. You want to join a team where QA is seen as a critical component of the development process. And you thrive in a collaborative environment; where Product Management, Software Developers, QA Engineers, Architects and Operations team members collaborate to define/refine system requirements and use cases. And above all, you want to create industry leading products, use cutting-edge technologies and have time to enjoy all that life has to offer. 

About Quality Engineering at RelayHealth:
We are revolutionizing the way Quality Engineering is done. We work in small development teams, releasing code to our customers every week in a highly evolved agile environment. Quality is not an after-thought or the final gate keeper in the development process. Instead, we work in a holistic system where our QA Engineers are part of the development teams. Our work begins as soon as the development work begins, allowing us to give input into the development process to allow assurance and validation. The best part is that we are just getting started and every member of our team is impacting our automation validation strategy. And, our Quality Engineers have two distinct development paths: move into application development or move into more senior roles within the quality engineering team.

About RelayHealth:
We provide patient-centric connectivity solutions that make it easy for consumers and healthcare organizations to securely exchange information. In keeping with this objective, all of our solutions are designed to work on an open network for simple electronic system start-up or add-on solutions in the future. Why is this goal so important to who we are as a company? First, we belief that a streamlined, healthy exchange of information is better for everyone touched by the nation's healthcare system -- from patient to payer and everyone in between. Second, it reflects both who we are as a company and who we want to be.

Working in Emeryville, CA:
The RelayHealth Clinicals team is located in Emeryville -- located just across the Bay Bridge, in a beautiful bayside setting and just 20 minutes from downtown SF. The city is a truly urban experience, with a beautiful Marina Park (and boating berths), the Emeryville Greenway (linear park), and some of the best shopping in the East Bay.

Emeryville is also a transportation hub, sitting at the crossroads of Highways I-80, I-580, and I-880. Don't want to drive? Just hop on BART and we offer a free shuttle that will deliver you to our office. Emeryville is also home to several Flex-Car (car share) pods so you have wheels when you need them.

To apply, please email us at careers@relayhealth.com and include your resume or LinkedIn profile.

Our flagship app for iPhone and Android recently won the most competitive category in Billboard's inaugural Music App Awards, and achieved top-ten honors from the New York Times, becoming the only music app to do so.

If you've worked on core technologies in a large company context, or have been an app developer licensing technologies that never quite keep up with your needs, you will appreciate the uniquely empowering experience of a workplace that combines people from both backgrounds -- literally within a few yards of each other.

We value creativity, innovation, hard work, open communication and fast iteration, which allow us to act on valuable feedback from employees and users alike. SoundHound's culture is one of impromptu coffee breaks, less-impromptu fitness sessions, group lunches, and regular happy hours.

About You:

  You are a highly motivated problem solver with excellent troubleshooting skills

  2+ years of hands-on QA experience

Do testers think of you as a coder? Do coders think of you as a tester? Are you strangely okay with this situation? Can you easily recall the last book you read about software or quality issues? Are you reading it right now? Are you writing it? Most of all are you ready to make an important and conspicuous impact both professionally and personally every day you're at the office? If you are, then we'd like to talk to you.

"Software Development Engineer in Test (financial district)","http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/3001302255.html",2012-05-07T16:50:09Z,"Are you someone who's excited about software quality but still loses yourself for hours in a particularly interesting coding problem? Do testers think of you as a coder? Do coders think of you as a tester? Are you strangely okay with this situation? Can you easily recall the last book you read about software or quality issues? Are you reading it right now? Are you writing it? Most of all are you ready to make an important and conspicuous impact both professionally and personally every day you're at the office? If you are, then we'd like to talk to you.

First off, we should warn you we're not a typical social media or casual gaming startup. Here at Medrio we provide our customers with a suite of web-enabled SaaS products that are revolutionizing clinical research. We're a mature (and profitable) startup software company whose client list includes industry leaders in the pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotechnology sectors, as well as leading academic research centers. So when you come to work here you might be helping build test code to verify iPad applications, but it won't be Angry Birds . . . unless Angry Birds saved the life of a relative or significantly improved their actual quality of life somehow. In that case it's just like Angry Birds.

Your job responsibilities here would include:Collaboratively design, implement, and analyze solutions to some testing problems we're finding more than a little challenging
    Drive our overall testing strategy by continually suggesting areas of improvement and introducing opportunities for innovation
    Fully engage as an equal in the daily design and planning activities for all our products
    Passionately act as the ""Voice of Quality"" (VoQ) on our products, processes, and activities
    Respond quickly and efficiently to rapidly changing situations without losing sight of long term strategic goals and vision
    Occasionally roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty in some manual test cases

Essential Skills and Experience:3-5 years of experience developing against the .NET environment
    2+ years of experience designing test automation of web applications using a statically typed coding language like C#, Java, or C++
    1+ years of experience writing complex queries using T-SQL and/or HQL
    1+ years of experience testing highly configurable hosted web applications (SaaS preferred)
    Working knowledge of object oriented design principles and theory
    Solid grasp of the fundamentals of test case design and management
    Demonstrable experience performing independent estimation and task management activities

Hard to Define Success Criteria:Passion (or at least intense interest) for quality within an Agile or Lean environment
    What's in your job descriptions is less important to you than what needs to get done
    You like having a spotlight shined on your work but realize most success is a team effort

About Medrio:
Medrio is an innovative pharmaceutical software company headquartered in San Francisco, CA. We provide our customers with a suite of web-enabled software products (software as a service) that is revolutionizing clinical research. We are a mature startup software company whose client list includes industry leaders in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors, as well as leading academic research centers.

Credit Karma is a funded financial services start-up located in sunny(ish) SOMA, San Francisco, and we're almost at 6 million users! 
With all of this growth, we're looking for quality engineers to find and destroy bugs. 

You'll get involved early in the product development cycle, analyzing upcoming features and figuring out ways to break them apart. You'll 
be creatively probing for security flaws, setting up test environments to unearth performance problems, and writing automated tests to 
make everyone's lives easier. Whenever you hear a developer use the words ""I assume"", your quality sense will tingle. 

Responsibilities

1. Awe developers with your bug count. 
2. Write test plans to break things in new and unexpected ways. 
3. Write automated test cases to regression test your features.

We're looking for a quick thinking technology enthusiast who understands how important quality is to the overall product. We are 
growing very quickly, and motivated personnel may find opportunities to move on to other positions down the road. 

Prior experience in quality assurance is not necessary. Prior software development experience or formal training (BS CS or similar 
degree) is a must.

Working at Credit Karma!
We help over 5 million consumers improve their financial situation through a completely free online credit management
service. Our San Francisco office is beautifully situated a few blocks from AT&T Ballpark, and one of our friendly office
pups will greet you at the door in the morning. We also offer:

Are you reading it right now? Are you writing it? Most of all are you ready to make an important and conspicuous impact both professionally and personally every day you're at the office? If you are, then we'd like to talk to you.

First off, we should warn you we're not a typical social media or casual gaming startup. Here at Medrio we provide our customers with a suite of web-enabled SaaS products that are revolutionizing clinical research.

ABOUT XOOM 
Xoom is an online money transfer company serving the $400 billion family remittance market. 
Backed by Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Xoom is shaking up the international money transfer industry. We offer a secure, fast, and inexpensive means of sending money for consumers and businesses to a large network of countries.

Consumers believe our competitive advantage is convenience and quality of service. Convenience is derived from the online versus offline experience coupled with an easy product experience. Quality of service is mostly demonstrated by speed of service where Xoom can pay out an order usually in minutes, but we also offer a unique ability to deposit money into non US bank accounts faster than any other service, and with total transparency to the consumer (no one can do this but Xoom). 

The Xoom.com site is the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive stack of technology. Our architecture includes engines for anti-fraud, compliance, payment processing, customized disbursement, treasury and FX, accounting and finance, and customer/partner operations. 

Of the industries that are affected by globalization, international money transfer has been one of the greatest beneficiaries. The increasing free movement of people has led to accelerated growth and a huge opportunity in this field, and Xoom will be there to service this growing market! 

Xoom is dealing with people's livelihood and they take this very seriously. Xoom is searching for smart and talented people to grow their company, and grow with their company.

"QA Analyst @Rdio (potrero hill)","http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/3015019859.html",2012-05-14T18:29:11Z,"Rdio http://www.rdio.com

What we do. . .
We want to make music fun again. No more wading through the Internet trying to find out what the new hits are, or to listen to an old favorite song again -- and no more managing thousands of MP3s you stopped listening to years ago. Instead we're putting together the best ways to discover, collect, share and play music in one, great product that's available on your computer, your phone and in your home.

Who we are. . .
Rdio was founded in 2009 by Janus Friis with Niklas Zennström, the founders of Skype. We're based in Potrero Hill area of San Francisco. We're funded by Atomico, as well as Janus Friis, Mangrove Capital Partners and Skype. 

What's it like here. . .
We're lean and mean. Fewer than 70 people create and maintain Rdio on the web and desktop, Sonos, iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 (and even more platforms are coming). That means you'll spend your time on apps and features that are carefully designed to create lasting value for our customers, and not in endless meetings. 

We're friendly and relaxed. We like to avoid frantic code-writing and design sprints by planning better and more carefully choosing what to work on. While the occasional all-nighter has happened, they're the exception, not the rule. 

We're multi-lingual. Python, Java, Objective-C, C#, JavaScript and Erlang are some of the dialects spoken, but we really want to use whatever suits the job, not make the job suit the language. On the web, audio streaming logic is handled by Flash, while the front-end is all HTML/CSS. On other platforms, we do native front-ends and audio. 

The kind of person we're looking for. . .
Rdio is looking for a QA Analyst. Ideal candidate should thrive in an environment with lots of freedom, light process and frequent releases. You are:
	Organized and detail oriented
	Passionate about product quality and have a critical eye for software design
	A strong communicator and know how to explain complicated technical concepts clearly and succinctly

The kind of stuff you'll be doing. . .
Fewer than 70 people create and maintain Rdio on the web and desktop, Sonos, iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 (and even more platforms are coming). That means you'll spend your time black box testing and evaluating apps and features that are carefully designed to create lasting value for our customers.

You'll be helping to form the core of our QA organization and you can help shape our quality assurance process as we move forward. We're also looking for someone with strong teamwork skills and leadership potential.

The kind of experience we expect. . .
	5+ years QA experience in a consumer software
	Deep understanding of QA processes and techniques
	Solid understanding of web/mobile technologies and can discuss technical concepts

Bonus experience. . .
	Programming/scripting language development experience
	Experience with mobile OS and mobile testing methodologies
	QA experience in a web application environment, preferably a high traffic consumer facing site


We're a start-up, but our salaries are all grown-up. In addition, we have comprehensive health coverage (medical and dental), a 401k, and you will receive equity so you're in a good position to enjoy Rdio's future successes.

Cloudscaling makes clouds that work. We're building Openstack-based solutions for people who want scalable and robust production clouds. We need your help!

We're looking for someone to own our quality engineering processes. You'll be responsible for defining, implementing, and managing the processes that ensure our development team delivers code with quality built in.  If you have experience with test-driven development and continuous integration and a passion for quality, you may be the person we're looking for!  Note that unlike many traditional build or test roles, Cloudscaling is building integrated infrastructure consisting of software, hardware, and the processes that manage them.  This isn't your average ""write and execute a test plan"" role - you're responsible for ensuring that an entire infrastructure is being built and deployed successfully on a continuous basis! This is an engineering role, not a ""tester"" role.

We're big on deployment automation, not hugging boxes, minimal process overhead and just getting things done. You'll be joining a great team who have built systems at Amazon Web Services (AWS), GoGrid, eBay, Sun, and Rightscale.
Responsibilities

    Define, develop, and manage our quality engineering processes 
    Own the testing/validation process for the solutions we are building
    Play the lead role on the development team in evangelizing and advocating quality engineering efforts from unit tests to continuous integration

    Experience with test automation
    Experience with source code control and configuration management systems

We're looking for a quick thinking technology enthusiast who understands how important quality is to the overall product. We are 
growing very quickly, and motivated personnel may find opportunities to move on to other positions down the road. 

Prior experience in quality assurance is not necessary. Prior software development experience or formal training (BS CS or similar 
degree) is a must.

Working at Credit Karma!
We help over 6 million consumers improve their financial situation through a completely free online credit management
service. Our San Francisco office is beautifully situated a few blocks from AT&T Ballpark, and one of our friendly office

Do testers think of you as a coder? Do coders think of you as a tester? Are you strangely okay with this situation? Can you easily recall the last book you read about software or quality issues? Are you reading it right now? Are you writing it? Most of all are you ready to make an important and conspicuous impact both professionally and personally every day you're at the office? If you are, then we'd like to talk to you.

First off, we should warn you we're not a typical social media or casual gaming startup.

We're a mature (and profitable) startup software company whose client list includes industry leaders in the pharmaceutical, medical device, and biotechnology sectors, as well as leading academic research centers.

"Lead QA Analyst @Rdio (potrero hill)","http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/3037958592.html",2012-05-25T20:05:04Z,"Rdio http://www.rdio.com

What we do. . .
We want to make music fun again. No more wading through the Internet trying to find out what the new hits are, or to listen to an old favorite song again -- and no more managing thousands of MP3s you stopped listening to years ago. Instead we're putting together the best ways to discover, collect, share and play music in one, great product that's available on your computer, your phone and in your home.

Who we are. . .
Rdio was founded in 2009 by Janus Friis with Niklas Zennström, the founders of Skype. We're based in Potrero Hill area of San Francisco. We're funded by Atomico, as well as Janus Friis, Mangrove Capital Partners and Skype. 

What's it like here. . .
We're lean and mean. Fewer than 70 people create and maintain Rdio on the web and desktop, Sonos, iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 (and even more platforms are coming). That means you'll spend your time on apps and features that are carefully designed to create lasting value for our customers, and not in endless meetings. 

We're friendly and relaxed. We like to avoid frantic code-writing and design sprints by planning better and more carefully choosing what to work on. While the occasional all-nighter has happened, they're the exception, not the rule. 

We're multi-lingual. Python, Java, Objective-C, C#, JavaScript and Erlang are some of the dialects spoken, but we really want to use whatever suits the job, not make the job suit the language. On the web, audio streaming logic is handled by Flash, while the front-end is all HTML/CSS. On other platforms, we do native front-ends and audio. 

The kind of person we're looking for. . .
Rdio is looking for a QA Analyst. Ideal candidate should thrive in an environment with lots of freedom, light process and frequent releases. You are:
	Organized and detail oriented
	Passionate about product quality and have a critical eye for software design
	A strong communicator and know how to explain complicated technical concepts clearly and succinctly

The kind of stuff you'll be doing. . .
Fewer than 70 people create and maintain Rdio on the web and desktop, Sonos, iOS, Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone 7 (and even more platforms are coming). That means you'll spend your time black box testing and evaluating apps and features that are carefully designed to create lasting value for our customers.

You'll be helping to form the core of our QA organization and you can help shape our quality assurance process as we move forward. We're also looking for someone with strong teamwork skills and leadership potential.

The kind of experience we expect. . .
	5+ years QA experience in a consumer software
	Deep understanding of QA processes and techniques
	Solid understanding of web/mobile technologies and can discuss technical concepts

Bonus experience. . .
	Programming/scripting language development experience
	Experience with mobile OS and mobile testing methodologies
	QA experience in a web application environment, preferably a high traffic consumer facing site


We're a start-up, but our salaries are all grown-up. In addition, we have comprehensive health coverage (medical and dental), a 401k, and you will receive equity so you're in a good position to enjoy Rdio's future successes.

ABOUT XOOM 
Xoom is an online money transfer company serving the $400 billion family remittance market. 
Backed by Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Xoom is shaking up the international money transfer industry. We offer a secure, fast, and inexpensive means of sending money for consumers and businesses to a large network of countries. 

Xoom is the leading online alternative to a highly fragmented offline channel. This is an enormous market ripe for disruption with significant barriers to entry.

Consumers believe our competitive advantage is convenience and quality of service. Convenience is derived from the online versus offline experience coupled with an easy product experience. Quality of service is mostly demonstrated by speed of service where Xoom can pay out an order usually in minutes, but we also offer a unique ability to deposit money into non US bank accounts faster than any other service, and with total transparency to the consumer (no one can do this but Xoom). 

The Xoom.com site is the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive stack of technology. Our architecture includes engines for anti-fraud, compliance, payment processing, customized disbursement, treasury and FX, accounting and finance, and customer/partner operations. 

Of the industries that are affected by globalization, international money transfer has been one of the greatest beneficiaries. The increasing free movement of people has led to accelerated growth and a huge opportunity in this field, and Xoom will be there to service this growing market! 

Xoom is dealing with people's livelihood and they take this very seriously. Xoom is searching for smart and talented people to grow their company, and grow with their company.

"PHP QA Engineer (SOMA / south beach)","http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/3047354063.html",2012-05-30T20:41:31Z,"PHP QA Engineer
Portland, OR or San Francisco, CA

Are you ready to join a team of talented engineers solving tough problems -- and have a great time doing it?  Want a job that will equip you with a skill set you can boast about at conferences? Ready to be work for company that is setting the pace for technical innovation, growth, and customer delight?

We are looking for someone to join our PHP team who is a QA-minded developer. Someone who writes code more times than not - your code serves the purpose of ensuring quality wherever possible. And you serve as the expert for the team guiding process and development towards always producing a quality product.

What might you do working on the PHP team, you ask?  How about . . .

	Deploying a PHP application on AppFog or Heroku, and
	Developing a Symfony PHP application that makes heavy use of external services calls, and
	Working on a testing framework that automatically regression tests the support for the myraids of PHP frameworks
	Facilitating a code or architecture review for a key new feature

Probably you can't, today, do all of these.  But you savor the challenge.  And you have shown that you can stretch to learn other challenging, new tools.  We currently support five different web app languages (Java, dot-NET, Ruby, Python, and PHP) with more to come.   And our customer base is growing rapidly. To keep pace with those customers and with our exciting new features, we continue to grow the engineering team - and a QA expert is core to any team.

A key component of our service is the agent that our customers install in their web apps. For PHP, this is a small, efficient extension that instruments their web application. The agent need to be of the highest quality, and that's where you come in: you will help define and execute the quality process for your agent team. As an experienced QA engineer, you'll participate in a broad spectrum of efforts ranging from software engineering process (when do we do code reviews?) through feature verification (did the engineers really implement all the corner cases correctly?), test automation and framework design and development (we never want to see a defect more than once and automatic trumps manual every time). 

Skills Required:

	QA experience in a production environment
	Experince in the PHP web ecosystem
	Proficiency in web application testing
	Experience developing test automation on Unix systems

Other skills that can make you stand out:

	Developing and testing large scale web applications in distributed environments
	Use of a variety of automation test tools or frameworks (e.g., Selenium, HtmlUnit, Cucumber, RSpec)
	Developing and testing web application performance monitoring tools
	Experience configuring and customizing continuous integration servers and processes

When you apply, tell us about why this job, this product, and/or this company is of particular interest.  And why you are the right person for it.

A Little About Us

Our mission is to make web applications run better, to make the internet more productive, and to make life easier for developers and devops. We are turning the APM marketplace upside down by providing SaaS products that deliver high-value functionality previously only available through enterprise software.

Backed by Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Xoom is shaking up the international money transfer industry. We offer a secure, fast, and inexpensive means of sending money for consumers and businesses to a large network of countries.

Consumers believe our competitive advantage is convenience and quality of service. Convenience is derived from the online versus offline experience coupled with an easy product experience. Quality of service is mostly demonstrated by speed of service where Xoom can pay out an order usually in minutes, but we also offer a unique ability to deposit money into non US bank accounts faster than any other service, and with total transparency to the consumer (no one can do this but Xoom).

The Xoom.com site is the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive stack of technology. Our architecture includes engines for anti-fraud, compliance, payment processing, customized disbursement, treasury and FX, accounting and finance, and customer/partner operations.

You'll get involved early in the product development cycle, analyzing upcoming features and figuring out ways to break them apart. You'll 
be creatively probing for security flaws, setting up test environments to unearth performance problems, and writing automated tests to 
make everyone's lives easier. Whenever you hear a developer use the words ""I assume"", your quality sense will tingle.

We're looking for a quick thinking technology enthusiast who understands how important quality is to the overall product. We are 
growing very quickly, and motivated personnel may find opportunities to move on to other positions down the road. 

Prior experience in quality assurance is not necessary. Prior software development experience or formal training (BS CS or similar 
degree) is a must.

Working at Credit Karma!
We help over 6 million consumers improve their financial situation through a completely free online credit management
service. Our San Francisco office is beautifully situated a few blocks from AT&T Ballpark, and one of our friendly office

ABOUT XOOM 
Xoom is an online money transfer company serving the $400 billion family remittance market. 
Backed by Sequoia Capital and New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Xoom is shaking up the international money transfer industry. We offer a secure, fast, and inexpensive means of sending money for consumers and businesses to a large network of countries. 

Xoom is the leading online alternative to a highly fragmented offline channel. This is an enormous market ripe for disruption with significant barriers to entry. Xoom's value proposition of convenience and speed of service, matched with a competitive price creates a compelling advantage over the entrenched industry.

We have been operating a money transfer network for eight years and send money to over 30 countries. We support cash pickup, bank deposit, home delivery and typically offer service levels in minutes. 

Consumers believe our competitive advantage is convenience and quality of service. Convenience is derived from the online versus offline experience coupled with an easy product experience. Quality of service is mostly demonstrated by speed of service where Xoom can pay out an order usually in minutes, but we also offer a unique ability to deposit money into non US bank accounts faster than any other service, and with total transparency to the consumer (no one can do this but Xoom). 

The Xoom.com site is the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive stack of technology. Our architecture includes engines for anti-fraud, compliance, payment processing, customized disbursement, treasury and FX, accounting and finance, and customer/partner operations. 

Of the industries that are affected by globalization, international money transfer has been one of the greatest beneficiaries. The increasing free movement of people has led to accelerated growth and a huge opportunity in this field, and Xoom will be there to service this growing market! 

Xoom is dealing with people's livelihood and they take this very seriously. Xoom is searching for smart and talented people to grow their company, and grow with their company. Xoom is a small company where everyone can contribute in a relaxed atmosphere. If you're looking for a challenge and enjoy working with other smart talented people, we want to talk to you!

About Devicescape
The single largest issue facing operators today is the high cost of carrying wireless data. Growing consumer demand for data services is taxing operators' limited spectrum resources and pushing them to manage subscribers and spectrum assets in creative ways. The classic network strategy of ""least-cost routing"" -- where operators push traffic to lower cost transport -- can be adapted to include WiFi hotspots. However, some carriers view this as a radical concept. 
Devicescape gives carriers the ability to offload data to a high-quality, crowd-sourced WiFi network. Further, Devicescape's policy-driven approach gives carriers comfort by allowing them to fully control and adjust the way they approach WiFi offload. The result is an offload solution that dramatically reduces costs for carriers and enhances user experience.

"Mobile QA Lead/Engineer for HotelTonight (SOMA / south beach)","http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/sof/3095034277.html",2012-06-22T22:46:44Z,"Hotel Tonight Starts and Ends with Great Products
 
At Hotel Tonight, we take enormous pride in the product experiences we deliver to both customers and hotel partners. We build amazing products by questioning the standard way of doing things. We are looking for an outstanding QA Lead/Engineer who shares our passion for beautiful, practical products that earn raves from our peers and our customers.
 
You may have seen our apps (or even booked a hotel through them!), but you should know that we're far more than an app developer. Because we've built the world's first mobile-only online travel agency, there's a lot of code behind the scenes to process transactions, interface with hotels and determine which ones go on sale each day.
 
Every day, the team faces the challenges of scaling to support our increased booking volume, building a unified global platform and adapting to the newest mobile technologies, all while keeping our apps fast and our UX clean and simple. To accomplish this, we utilize whatever technology is best to solve a particular problem, not necessarily the one we're currently using.
 
WHAT YOU'LL DO

 *   Rigorously and meticulously test our products to make sure they are free of bugs and have the best possible user experience.

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN YOU

*   An uncanny ability to efficiently find bugs and product issues, while testing on a myriad of mobile platforms and configurations.
*   Excited by and familiar with the tools and methodologies we use for building and testing great software, as well an eagerness to create or leverage new techniques for testing mobile applications.
*   Damn opinionated. Even if it's functionally correct, if something isn't up to our level of quality, even if it's not what you're working on directly, we expect you to make a stink and help us improve it.

WHAT YOU'LL GET FROM US

*    An opportunity to define mobile commerce and change the way people book travel.
*    Camaraderie of a great team that works incessantly to build the next great online travel company.
*    Great SF office location at 2nd and Mission. (If you don't live in SF,we'll move you here.)
*    Great perks: Annual travel stipend, money to buy mobile devices and customize your desk/rig, unlimited coffee and snacks, and a gong (that you'll get to bang when you ship something amazing.)

We're looking for a quick thinking technology enthusiast who understands how important quality is to the overall product. We are

degree) is a must.
