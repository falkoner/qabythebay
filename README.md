# Description
This project is a sandbox for me to get some practice in building Sinatra application. The idea behind it is to collect automatically job postings for QA positions in Bay Area. Later on I'm planning to add more services parsing (like indeed.com), some statistics (group postings by weeks, count totals and averages), do data visualization (postings per week histogram). At later point - add data scrapping from the postings (collect names of the companies, regions, salaries etc.) and apply some machine learning technics to extract skills mentioned in the postings. All this, of cause, should be accompanied with improvements on CSS and JS side, and Ruby itself.

Project is currently not hosted.
